Using a topical, conversational format, he aims for the TV show to be an extension of his weekday radio broadcast, with free-flowing topics and the ability to discuss issues that strike a chord with the audience. Along the same lines, he thinks it's important to present the content in an engaging manner, free of my-way-or-the-highway ideology.

You've got to expect solitude across frigid, remote landscapes with freezing temperatures, but even in the desolate wilderness you need a vet to help your ailing wiener dog. Enter <b>Dr. Oakley, Yukon Vet</b>, that follows the experienced Dr. Michelle Oakley, veterinarian, as she makes house calls across thousands of square miles in the Yukon 3/4 helping many species of animals, including an angry muskox, a caribou with a tumor, a defensive mama lynx, and a grey owl with an amputated wing. Accompanied by her teenage daughters and armed with humor as sharp as a scalpel, Dr. Oakley deftly juggles being a full-time veterinarian, wife and mom while taking us into the isolated regions of the Yukon.</p>",
